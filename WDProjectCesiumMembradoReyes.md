## The Clementine Project
>##### <em> Welcome to the world of Clementine, a girl who found herself through words and lost herself in fame. </em>

#### This website is the personal blog of a fictional writer, Clementine. She owns a semi-popular blog on the internet called Clemmy’s Corner, where she talks about her daily life, her interests in fashion and photography, and all the things you’d expect from a teenage girl. Due to her easygoing and delightful personality, she’s amassed a small yet loyal following over the years and enjoys their kind words and thoughtful gifts. But one day, something unexpected happened. Her blog’s popularity exploded overnight. People began to flock to her website, leaving comments and likes. At first, Clementine tried to keep up, posting more often, smiling more brightly, sharing deeper pieces of herself for relatability. But the internet was never content. Every post, every picture, every word had to be perfect. What began as a simple diary slowly became a stage, and in the crowds of likes and lies, Clementine became no more.
